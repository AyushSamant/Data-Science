Definition:

Analysis: The process of examining data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. It often involves breaking down complex data into simpler, more understandable components.
Analytics: A broader term that encompasses the tools, technologies, and methodologies used to perform analysis. It includes data collection, storage, processing, and the application of algorithms and statistical methods to derive actionable insights.
Scope:

Analysis: Often specific and focused on answering particular questions or solving specific problems.
Analytics: Comprehensive and ongoing, covering a wide range of processes from data management to predictive modeling and decision support.
Approach:

Analysis: Typically descriptive, looking at historical data to understand what happened.
Analytics: Can be descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive, aiming not only to understand past events but also to predict future outcomes and recommend actions.
Tools and Techniques:

Analysis: Relies on statistical methods, data visualization, and reporting tools.
Analytics: Utilizes advanced tools and techniques such as machine learning, data mining, big data technologies, and artificial intelligence.
Outcome:

Analysis: Provides insights and answers to specific questions, helping in understanding past performance.
Analytics: Delivers deeper insights, predictions, and recommendations that can guide future actions and strategies.
Examples:

Analysis: A report showing last quarter’s sales performance, identifying which products sold the most.
Analytics: A predictive model forecasting next quarter’s sales and suggesting optimal inventory levels.

Past:

Business Case Studies: Traditional method of using historical data to understand past business scenarios and outcomes.
Preliminary Data Report: Basic data collection and initial reporting without in-depth analysis.
Present:

Business Intelligence (BI): Focuses on reporting with visuals, creating dashboards, and generating real-time dashboards to provide current insights.
Qualitative Analytics: Analysis that focuses on non-numeric data to understand patterns and insights.
Business Analytics: Encompasses more advanced methods like sales forecasting and other predictive analyses.
Future:

Data Science: Involves more sophisticated techniques for optimization and operational efficiency, such as optimization of drilling operations.
Data Analytics: Advanced data processing techniques, such as digital signal processing, aimed at extracting more meaningful insights from data.
Machine Learning: Utilizes algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.
AI (Artificial Intelligence): The most advanced stage, where systems are capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
Overall Progression:
The image demonstrates a shift from basic, historical data reporting to more advanced, predictive, and prescriptive analytics.
As we move from past to future, the methods and technologies used become more sophisticated, with a greater emphasis on advanced analytics and AI.
Applications:
Present: Current applications include business intelligence tools for reporting and creating dashboards.
Future: Future applications aim at optimization, advanced data processing, machine learning, and AI to drive decision-making and operational efficiency.
Implications:
Organizations must evolve from basic reporting and analytics to adopt more advanced data science and AI techniques to stay competitive.
The shift indicates an increasing reliance on data-driven decision-making processes, requiring investments in technology and expertise.
This visualization effectively shows the continuum of data-related practices from basic reporting to advanced analytics and AI, highlighting the evolving landscape of data science and its applications.
